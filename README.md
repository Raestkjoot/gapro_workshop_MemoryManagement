# C++ Pointers and Memory Management
These are TA workshop exercises for the Game Programming course 2024. The aim is to get comfortable with basic use of pointers and memory management.

What you need to do for each exercise can be found in the code itself, to get started with an exercise take a look at the `main()` function. Comments in the code tell you what you need to do, for example `//TODO 1.1: ...` will tell you what to do in exercise 1.1. 

## Exercise 1: Pointers
In this exercise we try out basic use of raw pointers. Everything is in the `main.cpp` file in the `exercises-1` folder.

## Exercise 2: References
In this exercise we try pass-by-reference. Everything is in the `main.cpp` file in the `exercises-2` folder.

## Exercise 3: Smart Pointers
The practical requirements for memory management in this course only require that you know how to use smart pointers. In this exercise there are a few more files, just so we can get used to working in the context of game programming. Just like with the other exercises, the entry point is `exercises-3/main.cpp`.

### Exercise 3.1 - 3.3
These are similar to the first two exercise sets, the goal is just to do some basic operations with smart pointers. This time the functions are declared in `ExerciseFunctions.h` and defined in `ExerciseFunctions.cpp`, so you will have to jump between files a little.

### Exercise 3.4 - 3.5
This is where we try out smart pointers in the context of game programming. These exercises represent a large part of what you will be expected to code in this course using smart pointers.
